Hello! My name is Mykola and this is a little description for test task.

I. First of all - How to run project on your local computer. To run project, please, follow this steps:

  1. Create new virtualenv for this project;
  2. Install all libraries from requirements.txt;
  3. Run your new virtualenv, go to project folder and write this command in your terminal:
          For Windows: python manage.py runserver
          For Linux:   python3 manage.py runserver
  4. Congratulations! Now your server is run! Go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/".

II. Now let's talk about the possibilities of the application.

    1. To see all medias go to home directory ("http://127.0.0.1:8000/");
    2. First of all, you need to register ("/register/"), or login (go to "/login" and use login: admin, pass: admin);
    3. Use navigation menu on the top for add new media to website:
          Add new media - adds new media to the site. Files will be uploaded from the local computer.
          Add new media via Instagram - adds new media using instagram post link. (you can use links like "https://www.instagram.com/p/BZiDWSXHTEW/")
    4. On media page, you can edit your media. Go to "Mine medias" using navigation menu, then click on "Edit" button.

Thank you! Hope you will like my project!
Mykola.
